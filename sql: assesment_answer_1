Given the following tables:


SELECT runners.* 
FROM runners 
LEFT JOIN races ON runners.id = races.winner_id 
WHERE races.winner_id IS NULL;

Another way to avoid NULL issue with NOT IN is to explicitly filter out NULL values from the subquery:

SELECT * FROM runners 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT winner_id FROM races 
  WHERE winner_id IS NOT NULL
);
